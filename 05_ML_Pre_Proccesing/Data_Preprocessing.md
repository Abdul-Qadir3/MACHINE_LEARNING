# <b> Data Preprocessing techniques
## Data cleaning
- Tidyup data
- Discard data or in use also called ouliers
- Handling missing values 
  - Imputation or removal
## Data Integeration or data polling
- Merge datasets together based on common variables.
- The type of merge can be: inner join, left_join, right_join and full_join.
- Data Duplication Deal
## Data Transformation
- Data scaling
- Normalization
- Data Agregation(combining two or more variables)
##### Data Generalization
- Binned variable creation
- Low level data transformation to a broader level
- Also called `Concept Hierarchal distribution`
## Data Reduction
- Dimentionality reduction
  -  Reduce input column and include important once
  -  Techniques are `PCA analysis , Multivariate analysis`
  -  Numerosity Reduction
        - Convert categorical data into numerical form using `one hot encoding or label encoding`
        - Data encoding techniques
        - `Data compression`
## Data Discritization
- Data discretization, also known as binning or bucketing, is the process of transforming continuous data into discrete intervals or categories
