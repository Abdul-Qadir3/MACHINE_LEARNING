## What is machine learning?
Allows machine to `learn` and make `decisions smartly`
In ML Machines learn from `data` provided

# steps for ML
- 1. Define the problem
- 2. Data collection -> Gathering Data 
- 3. Data Pre-Processing -> Cleaning the data/ wrangling 80% of time in data processing
- 4. Choose a Model
  - `Classification` Algos -> Categorical
  - `Regression` Algos => Numerical
  - Both the types have separate Algorithms
- 5. Spliting the Data
  - `X` in independent can be one or more varible based on we predict `y`
    - Its also called `Predictors`, `input`, `features`
  - `y` is dependent is also known as `Output`, `label`

- 6. `Evaluating` the model Metrics
   - `Metrics` used for the model evaluation like `R-square` , `RMSE` and `MSE`
- 7. `Hyper-Parameter` Tunning if model not working well will increase the performance of the model this requres model in `depth knowlege` and `theoratical` understanding
- 8. `Cross Validation` train same model on different `subset` of the data which will `increase` model accuracy
  - Removing the biasness from the data
- 9. `Model Finalization` by multi data validation
- 10. `Deploy Model` like on App, webapp, software -> MLOps
- 11. `Retest`, `Update`, control the `versioning`, and `Monitor`
